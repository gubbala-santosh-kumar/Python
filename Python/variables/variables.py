# Python Varaibles Concept:

"""
    In this Python we have some rules for creating variables:
    --Rules--
     -> varaibles must starts with (a-z),(A-Z) or ( _ )
     -> should not starts whith a Number or any other special Characters
     -> Variable name are case sensitive for example:  name != NAME
     -> For assign a value to Variables we must use an Operator called as Assignment Operator (=)
"""

#  See some examples for variables :

Python_Father_Name = "Guido van Rossum"    #---> String Variable

Python_Introduced_Year = 1991              #---> Integer Variable 

Current_Python_Version = 3.7               #---> Float Variable

Does_python_is_easy_to_learn = True      #---> Boolean Variable

print("Father of Python :",Python_Father_Name)

print("Introduced in :",Python_Introduced_Year)

print("Current Python Version", Current_Python_Version)

print("Does Python is easy to learn : ", Does_python_is_easy_to_learn)
